            <p><li>Meanwhile, place a heavy bottom saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour in the oil, heat up a bit, add the chopped portion of the onion and bay leaves. Allow cooking for 2 minutes. As soon as the onion and bay leave become aromatic, add the tomato paste, and fry for about 2 minutes. Add the pureed mix, cover, and bring to a boil for 15 minutes. ½ cup vegetable oil, 2 dried bay leaves, 2 tablespoons tomato paste</li></p>

                <li>1 whole smoked mackerel any animal protein works. About 12. oz</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Divide the okra in half. Place one-half in the food processor. Add the habanero, onion, and fresh ginger. Give it a few pulses until it reaches your desired consistency. Set aside</li>
                <p><li>Finely chop the other half. Set it aside for later. Slice off the stem end of the pod, then cut down the center lengthwise. Do that twice. Then cut thin slices crosswise.</li></p>
                <p><li>Add the stock into a non-stick pot or saucepan and bring to a boil on medium-high heat (about 10 mins). Add the dried catfish, and cook for 5 minutes uncovered. Remove the fish from the pot and set it over a wide plate. Once cooled, pull apart the head of the fish and remove any bones leaving only the part with flesh. Set it aside.</li></p>
                <p><li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the okra from the food processor, shrimp, crayfish, and seasoning cube into the pot with broth. Stir to combine and cook for 5 mins, uncovered.</li></p>
                <p><li>Add the cleaned dry fish and chopped bell peppers. Cook for about 3 minutes.</li></p>
                <p><li>Add the sliced okra with chopped kale, and stir to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes. Adjust seasoning to taste.</li></p>
                <p><li>Add the smoked mackerel, and fold in the okra soup in a circular motion, so the fish remains whole. Cook for a minute or so. ( or cut the fish however you like)</li></p>
                <p><li>Remove from heat. Ladle the soup into individual serving bowls and serve with fufu, pounded yam, kenkey, semolina, eba (garri), or any swallow of choice.</li></p>
            </ol>
